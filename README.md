# Animated-Walking-Tracker
An animated real time walking route from MIT to Harvard Hall using specific longitude and latitude from google maps. I customized my map using MapBox and came up with a 3D layer of map.

Instruction: 
	• In the File menu, click Clone Repository.
	• Click the tab that corresponds to the location of the repository you want to clone.
	• Choose the repository you want to clone from the list.
	• Click choose and navigate to a local path where you want to clone the repository.
	• Click Clone.
	• Start running the file index.html
	• On the upper left, click the button.
	• Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" on your keyboard and then rotate the map to have 3D view of my customized map.
	• Then you will see a pin moving through the walking route from MIT to Harvard Hall. 

Roadmap to future improvements:
I will try to change the pin marker into an icon of a peron or car and move from point to point.
